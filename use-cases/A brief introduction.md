## An introduction to our business

#### We are a successful traditional Scottish restaurant chain called "The Flying Scot". After experiencing a decade-long successful business in Scotland, we plan to open our first branch abroad.
#### To choose its location, we require other information such as: details of countries and cities, capital cities information and a general overview of these data.
#### In addition, we'd like to have information about the native language of the population who will try our Scottish cuisine. This will help us to tailor the menu and the mobile app, and provide a better experience for the customer.
